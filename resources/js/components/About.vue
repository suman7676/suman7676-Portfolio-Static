                    Hi I'm a full-stack developer with the love of a UI/UX design. Listed skills include all things <span class="text-red-400 text-2xl">LARAVEL FRAMEWORK</span> , JavaScript, such as  Vue.js, and  as well as UI/UX design through Figma and Adobe XD.

                    Sometimes simple is best, and the slick black branding, typography, and copy show off personality as well as skills. This online portfolio is a good example of an SPA, where clicking a menu item scrolls you to the relevant section.
